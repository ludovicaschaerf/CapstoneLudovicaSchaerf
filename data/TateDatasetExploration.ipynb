    "## Exploration of the Tate Collection data\n",
    "This notebook contains an exploration of the data retrieved from https://github.com/tategallery/collection. This exploration is aimed at producing a target vector for the indended classification of the artworks in the collection according to their subject. \n",
    "\n",
    "As such, this notebook is comprised of three sections:\n",
    "- retrieval of the subject metadata\n",
    "- summary statistics of the data according to their subject\n",
    "- [TODO] the unpacking in a tensorflow compatible format of the data \n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieving subject metadata\n",
    "The repository cloned from github contains metadata in two formats: a csv file with some general metadata on all the images (not contained) and one json file per image id.\n",
    "\n",
    "The subject metadata is contained only as a section of the json files. This section therefore retrieves all the subject sections of the json files and reorganizes them into a single json file for all subjects of all images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The json file produced is in the form of {class:{subclass:'ImageId'}} as it is convinient both as a target vector format and to unpack the images into the correct directories. \n",
    "\n",
    "NB that an ImageId appears following more than one path since each image contains, on average, more than one subject. "
